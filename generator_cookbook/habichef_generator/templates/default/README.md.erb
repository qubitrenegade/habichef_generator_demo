# <%= cookbook_name %>

## Usage

This is a HabiChef repo.  It's supposed to be run as a Habitat service.

### Usage specifics

You do something?

Maybe create a /hab/user/<%= cookbook_name %>/config/user.toml file with your configs?

```toml
# /hab/user/<%= cookbook_name %>/config/user.toml example
[attributes]
  [attributes.ntp]
    servers = ["pool.ntp.org"]
```

This will set `normal['ntp']['servers'] = ['pool.ntp.org']`.
